# .devcontainer Configurations

This repository contains a number of different devcontainer configurations that are ready to be used in [VS Code Remote Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) development and
[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces).

## Instructions

Choose the folder that matches your project setup and copy its `devcontainer.json` (and `Dockerfile`, if it exists) into your `<project root>/.devcontainer/` folder. Then start VS Code with the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed and open you project inside the container.
